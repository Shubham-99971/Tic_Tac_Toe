Tic Tac Toe - Web Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game lets two players compete against each other in the classic grid-based board game, also known as Noughts and Crosses. With a responsive design and user-friendly interface, itâ€™s perfect for both desktop and mobile users.

Features:
Interactive Gameplay:

Players take turns to place their marks (either X or O) on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of aligning three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game alternates between the two players, and it automatically detects the winner or a tie.
Real-Time Updates:

As players click on the grid cells, the board updates instantly with their selected mark (X or O).
The game provides immediate feedback by displaying the result (win, lose, or draw) once the game ends.
Win Detection:

The game checks for three consecutive marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal after each move.
When a player wins, the game highlights the winning combination (row, column, or diagonal) for visual clarity.
Restart and Play Again:

After a game ends, users can restart the game with a single click on a "Play Again" button, allowing them to play multiple rounds without refreshing the page.
User-Friendly Interface:

The game interface is clean, responsive, and simple to understand, with a 3x3 grid and clear labels for the player turns (X and O).
The design is made with CSS, providing styles for the grid, buttons, and game results.
Responsive Design:

The game is designed to be fully responsive, adapting desktop.
No Dependency on External Libraries:

The game is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript without using any third-party libraries, making it lightweight and easy to understand for beginners.
How It Works:
Player Moves:

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and each player alternates between placing an X or O on the grid.
A player clicks an empty cell to place their mark, and the game checks whether the current player has won after each move.
Win Conditions:

The game checks for three consecutive marks in a row, column, or diagonal after every move.
When a player achieves a win, the game immediately highlights the winning combination and displays the winning message.
Tie Condition:

If all 9 cells are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a tie, and a "Draw" message is shown.
Resetting the Game:

A "Play Again" button allows players to restart the game, clearing the board and resetting the player turn order.
Technology Stack:
HTML5: For the structure of the page and the game grid.
CSS3: For styling the grid, buttons, and overall layout to make the game visually appealing.
JavaScript (ES6): For the game logic, player turns, win detection, and real-time updates to the game board.

This Tic Tac Toe game is an excellent way to practice basic web development skills in JavaScript while providing a fun and interactive game for users.
